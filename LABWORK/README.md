# LABWORK

Inside this folder you can find the pdf with the lab text, our code and the final presentation.

## THE CODE

The code contains every single step from the data download to analysis.
Since the size of the unzipped dataset is around 32GB, we have broken it down into smaller chunks in Google Colab, as there is 12GB of RAM, and analyzed the first two minute.
